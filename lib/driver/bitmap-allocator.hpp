     * Block allocator using bitmap allocating algorithm.
     *
     * There are two kind of special block used in this allocator, which are:
     *  - count block
     *  - bitmap block
     *
     * There is only one count block in one bitmap allocator, which is stored rigth after
     * reserved blocks by the holder of allocator, aka. the index of the count block is 
     * always `start_at`.
     *
     * The file is separated to several sections, and each section has only one bitmap
     * block. So there are several bitmap blocks in one bitmap allocator. The bitmap
     * block is located at the first block of the last operation unit of a section. when
     * a block is of 1024 bytes size, a operation unit is of 4 bytes size, then the 
     * bitmap block is located at the index of (1024 * 8) - (4 * 8) = 8160.
     *
     * When allocating blocks with a hint, the algorithm will start at the hinting 
     * operation unit and check the following one by one, by comparing the leading zero 
     * of each operation unit and the required length. Once find, length of bits starting 
     * from the least important bit will be set. It is the reason why that index of 
     * bitmap block is chosen.
     *
     * If following operation units from the hinting operation unit in the hinting 
     * section cannot feed the request, then operation units before the hinting operation
     * unit in the same section would be checked in revert order.
     *
     * If the request cannot be feeded in the hinting section, sections after the hinting
     * section would be searched first. If still not found, the sections before the 
     * hinting would be searched in reverted order. If still not found, a new section 
     * would be created. Hinting position would be ignored, when searching in sections
     * other than the hinting section.
     *
     * NOTE: length must not be greater than 8 * sizeof(OperationUnit) in one allocation
